# Plan your lecture with Docusaurus

- Add a new page called `teaching-with-docusaurus.md` to the `docs` folder.
- Structure the content to include:
  - An introduction
  - A practical hands-on exercise (e.g. programming exercise).
  - Make a quiz to test understanding.
- Deploy the changes and add the link to the lecture in the footer.
